Drafted 20 core information security and data protection [policies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJobxE_gfj1HPHPJU3e760mnIeJn0Jn2?usp=drive_link) and delivered the 2025 NDP Act Compliance Audit [Returns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10EVy-vHjMTsQrwi7X248SxMfspJebDSV/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) (CAR) for Manifestation Insurance Ltd (MIL).

Identified high-risk gaps in cross-border transfers, consent management, and third-party agreements, and built an operational privacy [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ytCpZT6yXjFjOOPF5gH84mpl2oOLeZy7/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) to embed compliance into daily processes and reduce regulatory exposure.

## The Approach

The audit followed a three-stage review: governance, technology, and accountability.

*   Created an operational [framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ytCpZT6yXjFjOOPF5gH84mpl2oOLeZy7/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) with clear owners and review cycles to turn the drafted [policies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJobxE_gfj1HPHPJU3e760mnIeJn0Jn2?usp=drive_link) into practice.

*   MIL populated the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lmnEf_FgnvJ9LsA8oPyHcahVx1a8um5q/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) mapped all data flows and processing activities.

*   Synthesized findings into a final [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10EVy-vHjMTsQrwi7X248SxMfspJebDSV/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true), framing gaps as business risks.

## Practical Insights & Recommendations

*   **Marketing Lawful Basis:** An over-reliance on "legitimate interest" for marketing was identified as a legal risk. *Recommendation*: Shift all marketing communications to an explicit opt-in consent model to improve compliance and customer trust.

*   **Cross-Border Data Flows:** Data transfers to the EU and UK were occurring but not properly documented or assessed. *Recommendation*: Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) focused on cross-border transfers and implement standard contractual clauses.

*   **Weak Consent Mechanisms:** Data collection points on websites and apps lacked proper, affirmative consent. *Recommendation*: Implement mandatory, unticked checkboxes linked directly to the Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions.

*   **Third-Party Contracts:** Agreements with data processors lacked specific NDP Act-compliant clauses. *Recommendation*: Update all contracts to mandate processor participation in DPIAs, define strict breach notification timelines, and require proof of sub-processor compliance.

## Reflection & Learning

Effective compliance starts with full client engagement in the audit process and is sustained by a genuine commitment to legal and regulatory obligations.

Future engagements will include structured post-audit reviews to close gaps, manage emerging risks, and strengthen controls ahead of the next audit cycle.
